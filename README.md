# Smart GRID: Summer Internship 2015
As a result of increasing use of renewable energy sources for power generation, the overall quality of electrical services has degraded. We propose a method that uses frequency as an indication of the current state of the grid and quality of power, and regulates it by deferring load consumption. We thus designed and are in the process of implementing an embedded system in a micro-grid testbed that regulates power frequency through control of the deferrable loads. Frequency measurements from a microcontrollerâ€™s counting hardware feature are transmitted wirelessly to a single board computer for further processing. An algorithm running from a single board computer accesses this information and determines when to turn on/off or change the threshold temperature the various deferrable loads, while accounting for certain aspects unique to each load. Considering these aspects allows the micro-grid testbed to potentially stabilize frequency and improve the quality of the power delivered.
